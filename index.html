          The group announces in 2022 that they will be focusing on individual
          activites for the time being. Media outlets blew the news out of
          proportion stating that the group was taking a hiatus. The reality is
          the older group members needed to have time to serve the military
          forces in their home country. They determined the best course of
          action was to continue solo activities and pause on group activities
          while the members serve their national duty. Currently, the oldest
          member, Jin has enlisted in the military and is serving his mandatory
          2 years. Other members have been busy with their individual
          activities.
